## FAQ Section

**Section Title:** "Frequently Asked Questions"

### Q1: Is my donation tax-deductible?
**A:** "Yes! Every nonprofit on Altrue is 501(c)(3) verified. You receive instant tax receipts for every donation."

### Q2: How does company matching work?
**A:** "Companies set a match ratio (e.g., 1:1, 2:1). When you donate $10, Altrue automatically processes an additional $10-$100 from the company's fund. You don't do anything extra."

### Q3: What percentage reaches the nonprofit?
**A:** "97% for individual donors (3% fee). Companies on Pro/Enterprise plans pay even lower fees (0.5-1%), meaning more impact per dollar."

### Q4: Is there a mobile app?
**A:** "Yes! Available on iOS and Android. Donate, track impact, and manage your giving on the go."

### Q5: How long does nonprofit verification take?
